<p>Salata de vinete is a traditional food made in romania. If you have not hear of vinete, then you might of heard of Baba Ghanoush. They are very similar in taste but Vinete does not have spice. Vinete is a healthy spread that can be eaten with bread, crackers and vegetables. For the people that dont like eggplant, dont worry you cant even taste it! I would know, im one of those people. </p>
